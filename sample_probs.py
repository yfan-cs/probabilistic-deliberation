Test problems for Project 1 -- Dana Nau, Feb. 14, 2018

Here's a list of all the test problems in this file,
given roughly in increasing order of difficulty:

[rect20a, rect20b, rect20c, rect20d, rect20e, rect50, wall8a, wall8b, \
    lhook16, rhook16a, rhook16b, spiral16, spiral24, pdes30, pdes30b, \
    rectwall8, rectwall16, rectwall32, rectwall32a]

Each test problem is a list of the form [p0, finish, walls], where
   p0 is the starting point;
   finish is the finish line;
   walls is a list of walls.

Thus if you have a heuristic named h1 in a file named heuristics.py,
you can do something like this:

import racetrack, sample_probs, heuristics
racetrack.main(sample_probs.rect20a, 'gbf', heuristics.h1, 1, 1, 'rect20a')

# A small rectangular region, with no obstacles in the way. There are four
# different orientations of the starting point and finish line, so you can
# check whether you're handling your x and y coordinates consistently.
